<h1>Abstract and Script : Keynote at useR! 2024 Salzburg, Austria
🎹</h1>
<p>Abstract: <em>“a(R)t is the engine for change”</em> Adam Grant said :
Great minds do not think alike. They challenge each other to think
again. In my opening remarks, I will borrow from Great minds in diverse
Literature and how they can guide us to create collaborations and
opportunities that span beyond the conference. I will also talk about
how we can take similar steps to make the work that we do, a part of a
long term-process for inclusion.</p>

### Slide : (Title slide) Art is the engine for change.</p>
<p>Good morning. My name is Audrey Yeo and I’ve travelled from
Switzerland to be here. I am a Statistician and Statistical Software
Engineer. For useR!2024 I am the Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
Committee Lead and on behalf of the sponsors, Linux Foundation and
myself, a warm welcome to all of you.</p>
<p>I am excited about the diversity we have in our R community because …
Great minds do not think alike, they challenge each other to think
again. Adam Grant.</p>

<div id="slide-all-are-welcome-here" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : All are welcome here</h3>
<p>I want to acknowledge the geographically and linguistically diverse R
communities that are in this room, and also joining us virtually.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the Neurodiversity in our community as
well.</p>
<p>I want to thank the broader DEI community and LF for all the patience
and hard work in educating me, on how to we make this conference more
inclusive.</p>
<p>Our volunteers from various R ladies chapters including Global,
Salzburg, R Forwards, rainbowR et al who have put their minds together
to bring this event to all of you.</p>

<div id="slide-events-past" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Events PAST</h3>
<p>Thanks to our DEI volunteers, in this conference we have had R Ladies
Meet up dinner and R Ladies Birds of a Feather Lunch. Yesterday evening,
we held Inclusive Pathways to Life Sciences and TEch careers.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-events-new-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Events NEW</h3>
<p>And today, rainbowR and Allies will have lunch together today.
Rainbow R is a community that supports, promotes and connects LGBTQ+
people who code in the R language.</p>
<p>That’s right. Not just people who make great HEX stickers.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-rule-10" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Rule 10</h3>
<p>Throughout the preparations for this conference we refer to the paper
by Joo et all 2022 on how to run a more inclusive conference. Our goal
was to make Rule no. 10, Rule no.1</p>
<p>We have given our scholarships, created Gender Neutral Bathrooms, and
community has contributed to a spotify playlist of songs from all around
the world including indigenous communities. I hope you found something
that made you feel welcome Slide : Inclusive Speaker Orientation</p>
<p>The Speakers of this conference have also taken part in making
everyone feel more included, that is, the inclusive speaker
orientation.</p>
<p>I want to read to you the definition of D and I from this course.</p>
<p>Diversity refers to the vast array of human differences especially
those that have been HISTORICALLY disadvantaged</p>
<p>Inclusion refers to systems that ACTIVELY include and support
individuals regardless of their identities</p>
<p>I will acknowledge the historical precedence for what makes our world
so divided in my talk as part of a long term process for inclusion. To
the attendees, I recommend that you too take this course which is
available on the LF website.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-who-am-i" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Who am I</h3>
<p>You may be asking, who am I ? Well, I am just like you. Navigating in
this complex world and doing my best.</p>
<p>I am a Clinician, Poet, Statistician and Software Engineer.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in Healthcare, Finance, Academy and now Pharma.</p>
<p>And maybe just like you, I cycle, Swim, Boulder, write and perform
Poetry. Slide : Why are we here ?</p>
<p>But why are we ALL here ?</p>
<p>Again I refer to Joo on what a good conference is.</p>
<p>A good conference experience can make a difference in the
professional development of the participants and create long-lasting
collaborations and opportunities (Joo et al, 2022)</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-our-vision-at-user2024" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Our vision at useR!2024</h3>
<p>Our vision here at useR!2024 is improve accessibility for the wider
community such that they can participate and feel safe regardless of
gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race,
ethnicity, age, religion or economic status…</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-how-do-we" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : How do we ?</h3>
<p>Create long-lasting collaborations and opportunities.</p>
<p>A safe space and</p>
<p>Make the conference part of a long-term process for inclusion ?</p>
<p>I have two suggestions.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-how-do-we-achieve-these-3-goals" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : How do we achieve these 3 goals</h3>
<p>Code of conduct. Please read the code of conduct. Be kind. Be
respectful.</p>
<p>The second I borrow from the arts. Let me share with you a quote from
a Malaysian novelist for the Booker prize book The Garden of Evening
Mists..</p>
<p>“A raintree bent towards a window in one side of the bungalow,
eavesdropping on the conversations that had taken place inside over
years.”</p>
<p>The imagery of this phrase likens to</p>
<p>Encouraging as people to listen in with care and consider the
accumulated journeys, iteration of thought and experiences, realities
and labor that precedes before the present time. We can be curious.</p>
<p>We can Be kind. Be Respectful. Be curious.</p>
<p>Before go more into arts lets go into the foundation of Science.
Statistics. Slide : Statisticians in History</p>
<p>Great statisticians on google are Calyampudi, Jerzy, David, Carl,
William, William, Ronald, John, FLORENCE, Bradley, William, Bruno … I
think you get where we are going with this.</p>
<p>I want to talk about Florence Nightingale. The German Wikipedia in my
view has a more inclusive summary of whe FN was. I know bc I studied
both a M Nursing and a M Statistics.</p>
<p>FN according to the DE wikipedia, was a British Nurse, Statistician,
and founder of modern Western Nursing.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know about her, FN was born about 300 years ago to a
wealthy and well connected family which is start of her legacy as well.
Her father took charge of her and her sisters education, allowing for
them to study modern and ancient languages, music, painting, sewing and
when FN was 20, at her insistence, her father paid for mathematics
lessons. As she was well connected and made long EU trips, she had the
opportunity to observe a German head of nursing and was asked to be a
superintendent of a nursing home and when the Crimean war broke out, she
also went in the efforts to nurse injured soldiers.</p>
<p>FN made headlines for her sharp judgment and call for reform of
hospitals. Calling out overcrowdedness and lack of air circulation for
causes and persistence of illness just to name a few.</p>
<p>If there was twitter and linkedin at that time, FN might have also
been viral on instagram.</p>
<p>There are many quotes from FN on nursing but this is one of
statistics. It says: “Their principle, if logically carried out, is
simply to throw out all ages and all diseases and then there would be no
mortality whatever.” FN encourage critical thinking of data integrity,
completeness of data, and highlighted the risk of bias and its
inference. These are features of modern statistics.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-on-florence-nightingale" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : On Florence Nightingale:</h3>
<p>Since Florence, we have had a more diverse statisticians coming from
University. And we need everybody on board to solve worldly problems the
way Florance has. We need Ronald, John, Bruno Carlo, David and…
more.</p>
<p>So when you go to your sessions and quote positively of your
experience of the useR conference, please …</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-quote-inclusively" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Quote Inclusively</h3>
<p>Quote her, Quote they, Quote them as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-learn-something-new" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Learn something “new”</h3>
<p>My wish for you to create long lasting collaborations and
opportunities to learn something new</p>
<p>Medicine and nursing has learned so much from the aviation industry
on how to behave in an emergency situation where time is life. Aviation
taught medicine and nursing How to communicate in a completely
unambiguous way so that every effort of the HCW is centered to making
sure the patient has the best outcome.</p>
<p>This is a paper written about the innovation when Medicine went to an
Aviation conference session. I think you know what I mean. So learn
something new, and maybe your long lasting collabortion will change the
world for the better.</p>
<p>Please refer to this paper which illuminates this example, also
written by a nurse.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-people-are-more-than-1-thing" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : People are more than 1 thing</h3>
<p>With long lasting collaborations and time we see that people are more
than 1 thing. When we want everybody on board, we have to keep this in
mind. I continue to borrow from the Arts This is a quote from a nigerian
author, Chimamanda:</p>
<p>“The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with
stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.
They make one story become the only story.”</p>
<p>So please, be like Florence Nightingal, be like Chimanda, know that
people can be more than 1 thing.</p>
</div>
<div id="slide-assume-you-have-diﬀerent-realities-from-others"
class="section level2">
<h2>Slide : Assume you have diﬀerent realities from others</h2>
<p>I’d like to bring the previous point home, on how to keep safe spaces
for everybody.</p>
<p>I quote Chimamanda again ;: “I did not think of myself as black and I
only became black when I came to America.”</p>
<p>I can relate this this.</p>
<p>As an Asian woman in growing up in Australia and in Europe, I don’t
see what a “big deal” it is to look the way i do, to others. It can feel
undignifying, dehumanizing and exhausting, to navigate the body I own in
a world that makes me feel that my culture and body is a narrative that
excludes mine.</p>
<p>Therefore when I read out to you the definition of diversity, and
quote about the raintree eavesdropping on the side of a bungalow and
realising that there were years before it, I am alluding to the history
and precedence that make surface level differences, more deep and
deserving of our attention. Slide : Recommended Books</p>
<p>Here are some books That our DEI community has put together and we
hope it make for part of the conference’s long term pursuit for
inclusion. I hope you take part in this force.</p>
<div id="slide-in-summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : In summary</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the Code of Conduct</li>
<li>Open yourself up to Missing Information</li>
<li>Quote inclusively</li>
<li>Drop by the rainbowR and Allies Lunch</li>
<li>We make decisions all the time based on incomplete information.
These decisions can change lives. - Be Curious</li>
<li>Take the Inclusive Speaker orientation course (Linux
Foundation)</li>
</ol>
<p>After the conference</p>
<p>And after the conference, I hope that you get to continue the work
you love you do, and make your work part of a long-term process for
inclusion because…</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Because Great minds do not think alike</h3>
<p>Great minds do not think alike.</p>
<p>I will conclude with a quote from the Arts. Haruki Murakami in his
book What I talk about when I talk about running:</p>
<p>“Sometimes taking the time is a shortcut”</p>
<p>So thank you for your attention and please take your time.</p>

Poetry. Slide : Why are we here ?</p>
<p>But why are we ALL here ?</p>
<p>Again I refer to Joo on what a good conference is.</p>
<p>A good conference experience can make a difference in the
professional development of the participants and create long-lasting
collaborations and opportunities (Joo et al, 2022)</p>

<h3>Slide : How do we achieve these 3 goals</h3>
<p>Code of conduct. Please read the code of conduct. Be kind. Be
respectful.</p>
<p>The second I borrow from the arts. Let me share with you a quote from
a Malaysian novelist for the Booker prize book The Garden of Evening
Mists..</p>
<p>“A raintree bent towards a window in one side of the bungalow,
eavesdropping on the conversations that had taken place inside over
years.”</p>
<p>The imagery of this phrase likens to</p>
<p>Encouraging as people to listen in with care and consider the
accumulated journeys, iteration of thought and experiences, realities
and labor that precedes before the present time. We can be curious.</p>
<p>We can Be kind. Be Respectful. Be curious.</p>
<p>Before go more into arts lets go into the foundation of Science.
Statistics. Slide : Statisticians in History</p>
<p>Great statisticians on google are Calyampudi, Jerzy, David, Carl,
William, William, Ronald, John, FLORENCE, Bradley, William, Bruno … I
think you get where we are going with this.</p>
<p>I want to talk about Florence Nightingale. The German Wikipedia in my
view has a more inclusive summary of whe FN was. I know bc I studied
both a M Nursing and a M Statistics.</p>
<p>FN according to the DE wikipedia, was a British Nurse, Statistician,
and founder of modern Western Nursing.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know about her, FN was born about 300 years ago to a
wealthy and well connected family which is start of her legacy as well.
Her father took charge of her and her sisters education, allowing for
them to study modern and ancient languages, music, painting, sewing and
when FN was 20, at her insistence, her father paid for mathematics
lessons. As she was well connected and made long EU trips, she had the
opportunity to observe a German head of nursing and was asked to be a
superintendent of a nursing home and when the Crimean war broke out, she
also went in the efforts to nurse injured soldiers.</p>
<p>FN made headlines for her sharp judgment and call for reform of
hospitals. Calling out overcrowdedness and lack of air circulation for
causes and persistence of illness just to name a few.</p>
<p>If there was twitter and linkedin at that time, FN might have also
been viral on instagram.</p>
<p>There are many quotes from FN on nursing but this is one of
statistics. It says: “Their principle, if logically carried out, is
simply to throw out all ages and all diseases and then there would be no
mortality whatever.” FN encourage critical thinking of data integrity,
completeness of data, and highlighted the risk of bias and its
inference. These are features of modern statistics.</p>

<div id="slide-on-florence-nightingale-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : On Florence Nightingale:</h3>
<p>Since Florence, we have had a more diverse statisticians coming from
University. And we need everybody on board to solve worldly problems the
way Florance has. We need Ronald, John, Bruno Carlo, David and…
more.</p>
<p>So when you go to your sessions and quote positively of your
experience of the useR conference, please …</p>

<div id="slide-quote-inclusively-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : Quote Inclusively</h3>
<p>Quote her, Quote they, Quote them as well.</p>

</div>
<div id="slide-learn-something-new-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Slide : Learn something “new”</h2>
<p>My wish for you to create long lasting collaborations and
opportunities to learn something new</p>
<p>Medicine and nursing has learned so much from the aviation industry
on how to behave in an emergency situation where time is life. Aviation
taught medicine and nursing How to communicate in a completely
unambiguous way so that every effort of the HCW is centered to making
sure the patient has the best outcome.</p>
<p>This is a paper written about the innovation when Medicine went to an
Aviation conference session. I think you know what I mean. So learn
something new, and maybe your long lasting collabortion will change the
world for the better.</p>
<p>Please refer to this paper which illuminates this example, also
written by a nurse.</p>
<div id="slide-people-are-more-than-1-thing-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Slide : People are more than 1 thing</h3>
<p>With long lasting collaborations and time we see that people are more
than 1 thing. When we want everybody on board, we have to keep this in
mind. I continue to borrow from the Arts This is a quote from a nigerian
author, Chimamanda:</p>
<p>“The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with
stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.
They make one story become the only story.”</p>
<p>So please, be like Florence Nightingal, be like Chimanda, know that
people can be more than 1 thing.</p>

<div id="slide-assume-you-have-diﬀerent-realities-from-others-1"
class="section level2">
<h2>Slide : Assume you have diﬀerent realities from others</h2>
<p>I’d like to bring the previous point home, on how to keep safe spaces
for everybody.</p>
<p>I quote Chimamanda again ;: “I did not think of myself as black and I
only became black when I came to America.”</p>
<p>I can relate this this.</p>
<p>As an Asian woman in growing up in Australia and in Europe, I don’t
see what a “big deal” it is to look the way i do, to others. It can feel
undignifying, dehumanizing and exhausting, to navigate the body I own in
a world that makes me feel that my culture and body is a narrative that
excludes mine.</p>
<p>Therefore when I read out to you the definition of diversity, and
quote about the raintree eavesdropping on the side of a bungalow and
realising that there were years before it, I am alluding to the history
and precedence that make surface level differences, more deep and
deserving of our attention. Slide : Recommended Books</p>
<p>Here are some books That our DEI community has put together and we
hope it make for part of the conference’s long term pursuit for
inclusion. I hope you take part in this force.</p>
